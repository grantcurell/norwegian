## Snippits

In recent years, researchers in Norway and Sweden have found increasingly clear evidence of a disaster that struck the planet 1500 years ago.

In 1910, the Swedish geographer and reseacher of moss Rutger Sernander first launched the theory that the Fimbul winter may have been a real event in the Nordic countries. His hypothesis was that this was due to a climate disaster between 2000 and 2500 years ago.

At this time, two NASA scientists, Richard Stothers and Michael Rampino, published a scientific overview of known volcanic eruptions back in time. Much of their work was based on ice cores taken from ancient inland glacier ice on Greenland.

Archaeologists read the article. They understood that something very dramatic may have happened in the year 536.

The Fimbul winter then, meant several years in succession without a summer — which would have consequences about which we can only speculate for people who lived in the far north 1500 years ago.

Gräslund was also the first to estimate that the population of Sweden was halved in the 500s. Now that archaeologists know what to look for, these scientists are also finding more and more clues in their material. Today, archaeologists see that something dramatic happened to the farmsteads in Norway and Sweden 1500 years ago.

People moved. Or they disappeared. There are almost no grave finds from this period. Fine jewellery was no longer made. Beautiful pottery traditions in western Norway ceased.

## English Version

While mythology is not real it is rooted in history. In 1910, the Swedish geographer Rutger Sernander theorized that the Fimbul winter may have been a real event in Nordic countries due to a climate disaster.

Later, two NASA scientists confirmed that in the year 536 a volcano erupted covering the atmosphere in darkness. This led to several years without summer. Moreover, it is likely the Justinianic Plague struck at approximately the same time.


This led to the death of more than half of the Nordic population. It is for this reason that many believe ragnarok is an interpretation of the calamity following these natural disasters.
